#1- Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
#2- Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
#3- Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
#4- Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
#5- Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
#6- Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
#7- Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
#8- Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
#9- Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
